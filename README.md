# Student-Marks-Analyzer-Using-Python-NumPy

A beginner-friendly data analysis project that uses Python NumPy to analyze student performance data. The project demonstrates how numerical data can be stored, processed, and analyzed efficiently using NumPy arrays, along with statistical operations and conditional logic.

This project focuses on academic data analysis, including calculating totals, averages, grades, class toppers, and subject-wise highest scorers.


# Technologies Used

1. Python
2. NumPy

# Flow of Project

Raw student marks (hardcoded data)
-> NumPy 2D Array
-> Statistical Analysis (total, average, max)
-> Conditional Logic (grading)
-> Performance Report (student-wise & subject-wise)

# Project Features

1. Data Storage
- Stored student marks in a 2D NumPy array
- Maintained separate lists for:
    Student names & Subject names
  
2. Student-wise Analysis
- Calculated:
    Total marks per student
    Average marks per studen
- Assigned grades based on average marks:
    A, B, C, D grading system

3. Class Topper Identification
- Identified the student with the highest total marks
- Used NumPy aggregation and indexing techniques

4. Subject-wise Performance Analysis
- Calculated highest marks in each subject
- Identified student names who scored the highest
- Handled cases where multiple students have the same highest marks

5. Statistical Operations Used
- Sum, Mean & Maximum
- Conditional filtering
- Index-based selection
